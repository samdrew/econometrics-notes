# Shapiro-Stiglitz Model

## Principles

Tries to answer, why is there unemployment? Why not market clearing?

The model builds upon the provisions that 

- Individuals choose their own level of effort
- Identifying this is difficult for firms

Built on the structure of the incentivising workers to exert effort in their work. It uses unemployment as an incentive to avoid shirking,  The core principle is 

- Workers effort is a binary state - they are either Shirking or Working
- Companies have a single discipline method, in the form of their payment of wages
	+ reducing income will only induce more shirking, therefore unemployment is the only positive option
- Workers who can shirk and for whom it provides the best utility, will
- No hetrogeniety amongst workers/jobs

This model of wage pricing explains why full employment is not achieved.

## Findings

- No shirking condition - wage equilibrium
- Unemployment benefits increase wages
- Higher unemployment levels benefit individuals over companies
-
